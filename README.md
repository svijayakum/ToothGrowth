## Purpose

The purpose of this project is two part:

One to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution will be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. We will set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations and investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. At least a thousand simulations will be performed. 

Two to do a preliminary analysis of  ToothGrowth data set in the R dataset package. The data will first be loaded into R, basic summary tables and plots will be created then a confidence interval/hypothesis test will be performed to compare tooth growth to supplements given and dosages used.
